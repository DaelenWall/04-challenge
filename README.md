UConn Bootcmp chapter 4 challenge

## Description

## Process
After Creating my repository, I noticed that there was no files written out for me, so I used the 'touch' command to create an 'index.html' file and a 'style.css' file.  For the HTML, I just decided to copy it off of my challenge-03 homework and fine-tune it a bit.  For the CSS, I left it as is.  After a quick review of the instructions, it looked like the 'High Scores' page was its own seperate webpage.  So, I did some google searches and found that for a 'High Scores' page on simple games like Minesweeper, for example, it is common to have 2 seperate HTML files.  So I created 2 HTML files and 2 JavaScript files to complement them.
